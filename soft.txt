[07:38 PM] Interviewer 1
Uh, cool. So I'll just get into it. Um, could you tell me about a product that you use a lot, but has something that annoys you? Or is difficult to use?

[07:38 PM] Interviewer 1
Uh, cool. So I'll just get into it. Um, could you tell me about a product that you use a lot, but has something that annoys you? Or is difficult to use?

💬 **Question**: Describe a product you use often that has something annoying or difficult about it.

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- One product I use a lot is Slack for team communication.
- While it is great for messaging and collaboration, I find the search functionality can be frustrating.
- Sometimes, it is hard to find older messages or files, even when I remember keywords.
- The search results are not always relevant, and it can take a long time to scroll through them.
- I think improving the search filters and making it easier to find specific conversations or documents would make Slack much better for daily use.

[07:38 PM] Interviewer 1
No, not not not a product. Not not something you're building, just something that you use every day.

So the latency, it. So it sends SMS. But latency is very high on SMS. So wise latency high on SMS. Do you know.

[07:40 PM] Interviewer 1
So the latency, it. So it sends SMS. But latency is very high on SMS. So wise latency high on SMS. Do you know.

💬 **Question**: Why is SMS latency often high?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- SMS messages can have high latency because of how the SMS system works.
- SMS is sent through a "store and forward" system, not real-time like instant messaging.
- Messages are first sent to the carrier's SMS center (SMSC), which then tries to deliver them to the recipient.
- If the recipient's phone is off or out of coverage, the SMSC holds the message and retries later, causing delays.
- Network congestion, routing between different carriers, and international delivery can also add extra delay.
- SMS was designed for reliability, not speed, so it is not optimized for low-latency delivery.

[07:41 PM] Interviewer 2
Okay.

[07:41 PM] Interviewer 2

[07:41 PM] Interviewer 1
Uh but they don't always do that. Right. This is only for some transactions.

[07:41 PM] Interviewer 1
Uh but they don't always do that. Right. This is only for some transactions.

[07:42 PM] Interviewer 1
Uh, yeah. I guess I'm just, like, trying to understand, is this an issue with their UX, or is it an issue with just like the regulatory regulatory environment around around transferring money?

[07:42 PM] Interviewer 1
Uh, yeah. I guess I'm just, like, trying to understand, is this an issue with their UX, or is it an issue with just like the regulatory regulatory environment around around transferring money?

💬 **Question**: Is the delayed notification about failed money transfers a UX issue or a regulatory issue?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- It is likely a combination of both UX and regulatory issues.
- Regulations often require extra checks for certain transactions, like large amounts or international transfers, which can delay processing.
- However, the user experience could be improved by providing more immediate and clear feedback when extra information is needed.
- If the system waits to notify the user until after the transfer is attempted, it creates confusion and frustration.
- A better UX would warn users earlier or provide real-time status updates, even if regulations require extra steps.
- So, regulations may cause the delay, but the way the product communicates with the user is a UX decision.

[07:42 PM] Interviewer 2
Okay.

[07:42 PM] Interviewer 2
Okay.

[07:43 PM] Interviewer 1
So you. Yeah, they use optimistic updates. But why would they always need a reason. Why would they why would they wait to.

[07:43 PM] Interviewer 1

[07:43 PM] Interviewer 1
To ask you for it.

[07:43 PM] Interviewer 1
To ask you for it.

💬 **Question**: Why would a system using optimistic updates wait before providing a reason for a failed transaction?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- Optimistic updates show success to the user before the backend confirms the operation.
- The system may not know the exact reason for failure immediately, especially if backend checks (like fraud detection or regulatory compliance) take time.
- Some failures require external systems or manual review, which can delay the error reason.
- The backend might only receive the failure reason after processing is complete, so the UI cannot show it instantly.
- This approach can improve perceived speed, but it risks confusing users if failures are not communicated clearly and quickly.
- A better design would provide a pending status and update the user as soon as the real reason is available.

[07:43 PM] Interviewer 2
Okay.

[07:43 PM] Interviewer 2

Okay. All right. So what about, um, let's look at a software a software system that you've had to work with. That was. That was difficult. Like maybe something you owned or something you had to interact with in your job.

💬 **Question**: Describe a difficult software system you worked with and your experience handling it.

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- At Quantori, I worked on a high-performance computing (HPC) job orchestration platform that was complex due to:
  - Multi-agent backend architecture coordinating job submission, monitoring, and data retrieval.
  - Integration with various AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) and cost/latency-aware routing.
  - Conversational UI with advanced output types (charts, tables, breakdowns).
  - Hybrid backend with both Python (FastAPI) and Node.js services.
  - Full containerization and AWS deployment using Fargate/ECS and Terraform.
- The main challenges included:
  - Ensuring reliable communication between agents and services, especially for long-running or compute-heavy jobs.
  - Handling dynamic job templates and supporting new models or data sources without downtime.
  - Monitoring and alerting for both HPC and AI tasks using Grafana, Alertmanager, and CloudWatch.
  - Balancing fast user feedback (optimistic updates) with the need for accurate job status and error reporting.
- To manage this, I:
  - Designed clear service boundaries and robust APIs for agent communication.
  - Used containerization and infrastructure-as-code for reproducible deployments.
  - Implemented detailed observability and alerting to catch issues early.
  - Built extensibility into the system so new features could be added with minimal disruption.
- This experience taught me the importance of modular design, strong monitoring, and clear user communication in complex distributed systems.

More like. More like. Yeah. More like. What's some code you've had to work with that you found annoying? Like, maybe not so much library. More like. More like code. You had to. Maybe. Maybe it was something internal. Um, yeah.

💬 **Question**: Describe some internal code you found annoying to work with and why.

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- I once worked with an internal user account system for a large company (20,000+ users) that was difficult to maintain.
- The codebase had:
  - Poor separation of concerns—business logic, database access, and API endpoints were mixed together.
  - Minimal documentation, making it hard to understand the flow or reason about changes.
  - Many “magic numbers” and hardcoded values, so small changes required searching through multiple files.
  - Inconsistent naming and code style, which slowed down onboarding and debugging.
  - Lack of automated tests, so every change felt risky and required manual testing.
- To improve it, I started refactoring:
  - Extracted business logic into separate modules.
  - Added docstrings and comments to clarify complex parts.
  - Replaced hardcoded values with configuration files or environment variables.
  - Introduced code style checks and started writing unit tests.
- This experience showed me how important clean code, documentation, and testing are for long-term maintainability and team productivity.

[07:49 PM] Interviewer 1
So how would you resolve that if you were, if you were, uh, if you were going if you were to fix it, how would you fix it?

💬 **Question**: How would you fix an annoying, hard-to-maintain internal codebase?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- I would start by identifying the most problematic areas—like mixed business logic, hardcoded values, and lack of tests.
- Refactor the code to separate concerns, moving business logic into dedicated modules and keeping API endpoints clean.
- Replace all hardcoded values and “magic numbers” with configuration files or environment variables.
- Add clear documentation and comments, especially in complex or critical sections.
- Introduce consistent code style using tools like linters and formatters.
- Gradually add automated unit and integration tests to cover key functionality.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to run tests and enforce code quality checks automatically.
- Review and update the codebase in small, manageable steps to avoid breaking existing features.
- Encourage team collaboration and code reviews to maintain quality going forward.

💬 **Question**: Pick a framework or library you are very familiar with and talk about it.

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- I am very familiar with FastAPI, a modern Python web framework.
- I use FastAPI to build backend APIs for web platforms and microservices.
- I like FastAPI because:
  - It is very fast and lightweight, using async features for high performance.
  - It has automatic data validation and documentation using Python type hints and Pydantic models.
  - The code is clean and easy to read, which helps with maintainability.
  - It integrates well with other tools like SQL databases, authentication libraries, and background task managers (like Celery).
  - It generates interactive API docs automatically, which is great for both development and client communication.
- I have used FastAPI in production for building scalable APIs, AI gateways, and orchestration services, often combined with Docker and AWS for deployment.

[07:53 PM] Interviewer 1
So. I don't know anything about fast API. What are the key concepts I need to understand? If I wanted to use it effectively?

💬 **Question**: What are the key concepts to understand to use FastAPI effectively?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- You define API endpoints using Python functions and decorators (like `@app.get()` or `@app.post()`).
- You use Python type hints and Pydantic models to automatically validate and serialize request and response data.
- FastAPI supports asynchronous programming with `async def` for high performance.
- It generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc) automatically.
- Dependency injection is built-in, making it easy to manage things like authentication, database connections, and reusable logic.
- You can easily handle background tasks, request/response hooks, and middleware.
- FastAPI integrates well with popular Python libraries for databases, authentication, and background processing.

[07:54 PM] Interviewer 2

[07:55 PM] Interviewer 2
Cool.

[07:55 PM] Interviewer 1
Um, so what's the most complicated thing about fast API?

[07:55 PM] Interviewer 1
Um, so what's the most complicated thing about fast API?

💬 **Question**: What is the most complicated thing about FastAPI?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- The most complicated part of FastAPI is managing complex dependency injection, especially when you have many shared resources like database sessions, authentication, or configuration that need to be passed into different endpoints.
- As your application grows, organizing dependencies and making sure they are efficient and reusable can get tricky.
- Handling advanced request validation and custom error handling with Pydantic models can also become complex in large projects.
- Integrating FastAPI with async database libraries or background task systems (like Celery) requires careful design to avoid blocking the event loop or causing performance issues.
- Overall, the core API is simple, but scaling up with many dependencies and async integrations is where complexity increases.

[07:55 PM] Interviewer 1
It's interesting question, because it's designed to be simple.

[07:57 PM] Interviewer 1
So what are some trade offs with fast API?

[07:57 PM] Interviewer 1
So what are some trade offs with fast API?

💬 **Question**: What are some trade-offs with using FastAPI?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- FastAPI is very fast and easy to use, but it is still a newer framework compared to Flask or Django, so the community and ecosystem are smaller.
- It relies heavily on Python type hints and Pydantic models, which can add some learning curve and extra code for complex data validation.
- Because it is async-first, you need to be careful with libraries that are not async-compatible, or you might block the event loop and lose performance.
- For very large projects, managing dependencies and application structure can get complicated, since FastAPI is less opinionated than Django.
- Some advanced features, like background tasks or WebSockets, are supported but may require more manual setup compared to more mature frameworks.
- Overall, you get great speed and modern features, but you may need to handle more details yourself, especially for big or complex systems.

[07:59 PM] Interviewer 2
Okay.

[07:59 PM] Interviewer 2
Okay.

[07:59 PM] Interviewer 1
Makes sense. Um, what would you change about fast API or what bothers you about it?

[07:59 PM] Interviewer 1
Makes sense. Um, what would you change about fast API or what bothers you about it?

💬 **Question**: What would you change about FastAPI, or what bothers you about it?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- The dependency injection system is powerful, but it can get confusing and hard to debug in large projects with many dependencies.
- Error messages from Pydantic or FastAPI can sometimes be hard to read, especially for complex nested models or validation errors.
- There is no built-in way to organize very large projects, so you have to create your own structure, which can lead to inconsistency.
- Async support is great, but if you accidentally use a blocking library, it can silently hurt performance, and there’s no warning.
- Some features, like background tasks or WebSockets, feel less mature and require more manual work compared to other frameworks.
- The documentation is good, but for advanced use cases or integrations, you sometimes have to dig into source code or community forums.

[08:01 PM] Interviewer 2
Okay.

[08:01 PM] Interviewer 1
Cool. Um, I think that's good for now. Um, so how is your perspective on engineering changed? Uh, over the course of your career?

[08:01 PM] Interviewer 1
Cool. Um, I think that's good for now. Um, so how is your perspective on engineering changed? Uh, over the course of your career?

💬 **Question**: How has your perspective on engineering changed over your career?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- At the start of my career, I focused mostly on writing code that works and solving technical problems as quickly as possible.
- Over time, I realized the importance of building systems that are maintainable, scalable, and easy for others to understand.
- I now pay much more attention to code quality, documentation, and clear architecture, because these make it easier for teams to collaborate and for projects to grow.
- I’ve learned that automation, monitoring, and good DevOps practices are just as important as the code itself, especially for production systems.
- I also value communication and teamwork more, since successful projects depend on how well people work together, not just on technical skills.
- My experience with AI and distributed systems has taught me to always think about performance, reliability, and how to handle failures gracefully.
- Overall, I now see engineering as not just about building features, but about creating robust, reliable, and understandable solutions that can evolve over time.

[08:03 PM] Interviewer 1
Cool. So tell me about a time when you received a piece of critical feedback.

💬 **Question**: Tell me about a time when you received a piece of critical feedback.

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- Early in my career, I received feedback that my code was hard to read and didn’t follow the team’s style guidelines.
- At first, I focused mostly on making things work, but I didn’t pay enough attention to naming, structure, or documentation.
- My manager pointed out that this made it harder for others to review or maintain my code, especially as the project grew.
- I took this feedback seriously and started to prioritize writing clear, well-documented code and following agreed standards.
- I also began to review other people’s code more carefully, which helped me learn best practices and improve my own work.
- This experience taught me that code is read much more often than it is written, and that good communication through code is essential for team success.

[08:08 PM] Interviewer 1
Um, but these were. Two separate pieces of feedback. You got. Right? Okay, cool. Just wanted to clarify, um, because he talking about the second one.

Yeah. That's fair. Um, so tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a coworker.

💬 **Question**: Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a coworker.

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- I once had a conflict with a coworker about the best way to design a backend API for a new feature.
- We had different opinions: I wanted to keep the API simple and stable, while my coworker wanted to add more flexibility and options.
- At first, our discussions got a bit tense because we both felt strongly about our approaches.
- To resolve it, I suggested we write down the pros and cons of each approach and review them together with the team.
- This helped us see each other’s perspective and focus on what was best for the project, not just our own preferences.
- In the end, we combined ideas from both solutions, which made the API better and improved our teamwork.
- This experience taught me the value of open communication, listening, and being willing to compromise for the good of the project.

[08:10 PM] Interviewer 1
What are the metrics tell you? Like, I'm just curious.

[08:10 PM] Interviewer 1
What are the metrics tell you? Like, I'm just curious.

💬 **Question**: What do the metrics tell you? (Context: likely referring to system or application monitoring metrics)

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- Metrics give me real-time and historical data about how a system or application is performing.
- They help me understand things like response times, error rates, resource usage (CPU, memory), and traffic patterns.
- By looking at metrics, I can quickly spot issues like slowdowns, bottlenecks, or failures before they affect users.
- Metrics also show trends over time, so I can plan for scaling or identify areas that need optimization.
- For example, if I see high CPU usage or increased error rates, I know to investigate further and take action.
- Good metrics are essential for maintaining reliability, performance, and a good user experience in production systems.

[08:12 PM] Interviewer 1

[08:14 PM] Interviewer 1
Yeah. So I'm curious why you chose to use, a a separate, um, like, to use a new DB versus just charting your existing DB.

💬 **Question**: Why did you choose to use a new database instead of just extending or charting the existing one?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- I chose to use a new database when the requirements for the new feature or workload were very different from the existing system.
- Sometimes, the existing database might not handle the expected scale, performance, or data model efficiently.
- For example, if the new feature needs to store large amounts of time-series or unstructured data, it might be better to use a specialized database rather than force the existing relational database to handle it.
- Using a separate database can also help isolate workloads, reduce the risk of performance issues, and make scaling easier.
- In my experience, I always evaluate the trade-offs: if extending the current database would add too much complexity, risk, or technical debt, a new database is often the safer and more maintainable choice.
- I also consider operational factors like backup, monitoring, and team expertise before making the final decision.

[08:14 PM] Interviewer 1

💬 **Question**: What do you make sure an engineer you are mentoring understands early on?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- I make sure they understand the importance of writing clear, maintainable code with good documentation and comments.
- I teach them to always consider code readability and simplicity, not just making things work.
- I explain the basics of version control (like Git) and why frequent, meaningful commits are important.
- I help them learn how to debug and test their code, including writing unit tests and using logs to trace issues.
- I show them how to ask good questions and seek feedback, emphasizing that it’s okay not to know everything.
- I encourage them to understand the bigger picture: how their work fits into the system, and why reliability, security, and performance matter.
- I also stress the value of communication and teamwork, since software is built together, not alone.

One more question. Um, what's, uh, what's a memorable insight? You that you had recently from maybe a book or something you listened to or a conversation you had.

💬 **Question**: What is a memorable recent insight you gained from a book, podcast, or conversation?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- Recently, I learned about the importance of building systems that are resilient to failure, not just optimized for success.
- This insight came from a discussion about distributed systems and how real-world failures are inevitable, so it’s better to design for graceful degradation and recovery.
- It made me think more about adding observability, good monitoring, and clear error handling in my projects, not just focusing on the “happy path.”
- I now try to design features so that if something goes wrong, the system can still provide value or recover quickly, instead of just failing completely.
- This mindset shift has helped me build more reliable and maintainable software, especially in complex, high-load environments.

💬 **Question**: What is a recent insight you gained from reading, listening, or attending a conference?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- A recent insight I had was about the value of “small, frequent deployments” in software development, which I read about in an article on modern DevOps practices.
- The idea is that by deploying small changes often, you reduce risk, catch bugs earlier, and make it easier to roll back if something goes wrong.
- This approach also encourages better testing and automation, since you need reliable pipelines to support frequent releases.
- I’ve started applying this by breaking down features into smaller pieces and improving CI/CD pipelines, which has made releases smoother and less stressful for the team.
- It also helps with faster feedback and learning, so the team can adapt quickly to user needs or issues.

💬 **Question**: Do you have any questions for the interviewer?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- Thank you! Yes, I do have a couple of questions:
    - Could you share more about the current technical challenges the team is facing at Canary, especially on the full stack side?
    - How does the team approach integrating new technologies or frameworks, and what’s the process for evaluating them?
    - What does success look like for someone in this full stack role in the first six months?
    - How does the team collaborate across backend and frontend, and are there any unique workflows or tools you use?
    - Finally, what do you enjoy most about working at Canary?

[08:20 PM] Interviewer 1
Yeah. So what we tend to do is we have, like, an onboarding plan. We have a pretty, like, pretty like, straight up. So the first, like two weeks, like the first week, we're basically expecting you to get your environment set up. Um, and maybe do like one like a, like a 1 or 2 tickets, like 1 or 2 little tiny like, we like having people write code, commit code on the first week, the first first ticket you're going to do is probably like a bug or a tiny little improvement. And you probably do it with somebody else. Um, and then, like, we typically have like maybe like three, 3 or 4 other little tickets that you're going to do. Um, and I found recently because our, as our company gets bigger, it takes a little bit more time because like, there's more stuff to set up and understand. But like I say, that's probably the first two weeks is doing that. And then we typically have a project that like that we slotted about at about a week of work that will give you next, um, and like again, I usually give people like two weeks just because, like, um, so that's, that's because, you know, when you're, when you're just starting, you'll probably take a little longer to ramp up. Um, that's probably like the first month. And then subsequently it's like you might be working with an engineer with another senior engineer on like a project that they're leading. Um, and contributing, um, and say that, like, somewhere in like, the 3 to 6 month range. Like an engineers are often able to take on like, their own projects, like own something end to end and deliver it. Does that answer your question?

[08:20 PM] Interviewer 1
Yeah. So what we tend to do is we have, like, an onboarding plan. We have a pretty, like, pretty like, straight up.

Like an engineers are often able to take on like, their own projects, like own something end to end and deliver it. Does that answer your question?

[08:22 PM] Interviewer 1
Like, yeah, we our goal is to have people like like give them as much responsibility as they're ready, as they're ready for. Hopefully not too much. But like, you know, but enough responsibility as much as they're ready for. And as soon as they're ready to take big projects on. But on their own, we're happy to let them. But we're not going to throw. We're also not going to throw somebody into the deep end, because we've got we've got a big code base, has been around for a while. We have a lot of stuff. So we also want to make sure you have enough mentorship that you can, like learn things the right way and like get ramped up.

💬 **Question**: Does that answer your question about onboarding and early projects at Canary?

---

⭐️ **Answer**:
- Yes, that answers my question, thank you for the detailed explanation.
- I appreciate knowing that there’s a structured onboarding plan and that new engineers get to contribute code right away, even on small tickets.
- It’s helpful to hear that there’s support from other engineers and a gradual ramp-up to owning larger projects.
- This approach sounds like a good balance between learning the system and making an impact early on.
- I’m excited about the opportunity to work closely with the team and take on more responsibility as I get familiar with the codebase.

[08:23 PM] Interviewer 1
Yeah.

[08:23 PM] Interviewer 1
Yeah.

[08:23 PM] Interviewer 1
Yeah, we have. Yeah. Yeah we do. We yeah we I mean we we we try. Yeah I try not to throw people in the deep end at first. I guarantee you that one of your starters could end up being more complicated than like I think it is. And it will be. And I'll end up having to help you, help you fix it. But, like, that's, that's, you know, that's part of just like again, like sometimes things end up being more complicated than we probably two of them would be simple. One would be like a, you know, just like a simple, you know, add a field or something, and then one might be a CSS bug or something, and then one might be like, uh, turns out to be complicated, but, you know, not that complicated, but let's say like two days to 2 or 3 days, it could be 2 or 3 days of work. And I thought it was going to be like half a day. So sometimes that happens. But, um, yeah.

[08:23 PM] Interviewer 1

And I thought it was going to be like half a day. So sometimes that happens. But, um, yeah.

[08:24 PM] Interviewer 1
Yeah. Yes. Every, every engineer gets a subscription to either, um, cursor or copilot. Um, and then on top of that, we all have subscriptions to cloud code, even all the PMS have subscriptions to cloud code, which is a little bit dangerous because they've started trying to write PRS. Um.

[08:24 PM] Interviewer 1
All of a sudden you can just be like, if it's a one liner, you can just be like, you can just write a few tests and commit it. I've done that. I've done that at least once. I've just been like, okay, I'll take this. Um, but yeah, it's like everybody has AI, um, all code.

[08:24 PM] Interviewer 1

[08:24 PM] Interviewer 1
Has to be reviewed by human. Um, before it's before it's submitted. Like all code needs tests. Um. Like, we all use cloud code to make to generate tests. I'll admit. Um, but, yeah, it's like there's, there's a real review process. Um, but yeah, we use AI pretty pretty heavily. Yeah.

[08:25 PM] Interviewer 1
I have to think of which one, which one, which one to tell you about. Um.

[08:25 PM] Interviewer 1
Um, yeah, I guess I'll, I'll do one that I was just doing with this week. Um, it's like, so one of the, one of the two teams that I managed deals with mobile key integrations. So it's like getting getting wallet keys on, you know, get, uh, you know, like Apple, Apple Wallet or or or Google Wallet, like, we get you can get your hotel key on in the wallet and you can get it to work. So we actually just we're in the process of getting I think we have one provider working and we have one that we're in the process of getting. So I've been like like basically. I needed to jump in and write, write some code. And it wasn't working. And I ended up having to like, troubleshoot like this integration with with Apple Wallet and, uh, yeah, it's just like a lot of details, honestly. I was reading the docs like, you have to read the docs like someone had done it wrong and they hadn't read the docs. Clearly. And I read the docs and I figured out what you know, because if you read if I read once I read all the API docs, I understood what was going on. Um, so I read the API docs, I figured it out and then like, yeah, it's just like it just like finicky. There's just a lot of it's it's like complex. There are a lot of there are a lot of steps you have to get a credential. You have to wrap the credit. You have to use this API to wrap the credential properly. You have to send it to Apple like it's just like a lot of things we do like there are a lot of steps and you have to do them all, like carefully. Um, and that's really like I think that's the that's the biggest complexity there. I mean, there are other challenges that we have, but that's, that's just one that we one that we face, we do and we're doing a bunch of such integrations because like, we have to operate, we have to work with like all the major, all the major providers lock providers. Um, and yeah, so.
